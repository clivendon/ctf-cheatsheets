# OSCP Tools

## nmapAutomator

An automatic background recon tool: [https://github.com/21y4d/nmapAutomator](https://github.com/21y4d/nmapAutomator)

## Autorecon

Another automatic reconnaisance tool that does more than nmapAutomator: [https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon](https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon)

I often find that less automation is better when doing initial recon - Autorecon will do a lot of scans and not necessarily all of them will be relevant (some of them may even fail). I recommend building your own methodology first (perhaps by looking at the kind of commands these tools run) and practicing manual enumeration, and only using Autorecon once you're comfortable with doing it yourself.
